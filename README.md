## About picoLCD
picoLCD is a collection of functions to make interfacing with HD44780 based LCD screens easier
on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Rather than reading through data sheets to figure out the correct set
of instructions to send to the screen, picoLCD attempts to make it simpler, while still being
extremely versatile. It's as simple as copying the '.c' and '.h' files to your project, add some
'#include's, set some pins and off you go!

This is still very much a work in progress as I only received my Pico recently, and is primarily
designed around 8-bit operation of a 16x2 screen. Other sizes such as 40x2 and 4-bit operation are
also on the way once more progress is done on the current version.

Basic Instructions are below, with more detailed function documentation in 'picoLCD/FUNCTIONS.md'

### Wiring the pico

The Pico should be wired to the LCD as follows for 8-bit operation, with the Pico being plugged
into USB:
